# CRM Sales Opportunities Project

## Description 

This project involves the analysis of B2B sales pipeline data for a fictitious company that specializes in selling computer hardware. The objective is to gain actionable insights into the company's sales operations by examining various aspects of the data, including sales opportunities, product performance, account activities, and sales team efficiency.

**Data Source:** Maven Analytics.

## Objectives

The main goals of this project are to:

* **Assess Sales Team Performance.** How is each sales team performing in comparison to others? Identifying the top-performing teams and those that may need improvement.

* **Evaluate Sales Agent Productivity.** Are any sales agents significantly lagging behind? Determining which agents are underperforming and may require additional support or training.

* **Identify Trends.** Can any quarter-over-quarter trends be observed? Understanding patterns in sales performance.

* **Analyze Product Success Rates.** Do any products have better win rates than others? Investigating which products are more successful in closing deals.

A personal objective of this project was to strengthen my ability to write more complex SQL queries using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Window Functions. Additionally, I aimed to deepen my skills in creating advanced DAX measures and building dynamic dashboards in Power BI.
